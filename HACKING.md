# Hacking guide

## Development dependencies

Additional dependencies needed for development:

* [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/welcome/install/#local-installation)

* [stringer](https://github.com/golang/tools)

    `go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer@latest`

## Makefile targets

Update and build everything:

```
make
```

Run specific step:

```
make gen|build|lint|test|test_all
```

Update go modules:

```
make tidy
```

Format code:

```
make fmt
```

## Making release

To release a new version:

 * Create git tag

    ```
    ./make_tag.py --push <remote> <version>
    ```

    e.g.

    ```
    ./make_tag.py --push origin 1.2.3
    ```

    You can omit `--push origin` to only create a tag locally without pushing it to github.

* Wait until "Release" CI job completes and creates GitHub release draft.

* Edit GitHub release created by CI and publish it.
