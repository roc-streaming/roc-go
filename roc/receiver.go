// Receiver peer.
//
// Receiver gets the network packets from multiple senders, decodes audio streams
// from them, mixes multiple streams into a single stream, and returns it to the user.
//
// # Context
//
// Receiver is automatically attached to a context when opened and detached from it when
// closed. The user should not close the context until the receiver is closed.
//
// Receiver work consists of two parts: packet reception and stream decoding. The
// decoding part is performed in the receiver itself, and the reception part is
// performed in the context network worker threads.
//
// # Life cycle
//
// - A receiver is created using OpenReceiver().
//
//   - Optionally, the receiver parameters may be fine-tuned using Receiver.Set*()
//     functions.
//
//   - The receiver either binds local endpoints using Receiver.Bind(), allowing senders
//     connecting to them, or itself connects to remote sender endpoints using
//     Receiver.Connect(). What approach to use is up to the user.
//
//   - The audio stream is iteratively read from the receiver using Receiver.Read*().
//     Receiver returns the mixed stream from all connected senders.
//
// - The receiver is destroyed using Receiver.Close().
//
// # Slots, interfaces, and endpoints
//
// Receiver has one or multiple slots, which may be independently bound or connected.
// Slots may be used to bind receiver to multiple addresses. Slots are numbered from
// zero and are created automatically. In simple cases just use SlotDefault.
//
// Each slot has its own set of interfaces, one per each type defined in Interface
// type. The interface defines the type of the communication with the remote peer
// and the set of the protocols supported by it.
//
// Supported actions with the interface:
//
//   - Call Receiver.Bind() to bind the interface to a local Endpoint. In this
//     case the receiver accepts connections from senders mixes their streams into the
//     single output stream.
//
//   - Call Receiver.Connect() to connect the interface to a remote Endpoint.
//     In this case the receiver initiates connection to the sender and requests it
//     to start sending media stream to the receiver.
//
// Supported interface configurations:
//
//   - Bind InterfaceConsolidated to a local endpoint (e.g. be an RTSP server).
//   - Connect InterfaceConsolidated to a remote endpoint (e.g. be an RTSP
//     client).
//   - Bind InterfaceAudioSource, InterfaceAudioRepair (optionally,
//     for FEC), and InterfaceAudioControl (optionally, for control messages)
//     to local endpoints (e.g. be an RTP/FECFRAME/RTCP receiver).
//
// # FEC scheme
//
// If InterfaceConsolidated is used, it automatically creates all necessary
// transport interfaces and the user should not bother about them.
//
// Otherwise, the user should manually configure InterfaceAudioSource and
// InterfaceAudioRepair interfaces:
//
//   - If FEC is disabled (FecEncodingDisable), only
//     InterfaceAudioSource should be configured. It will be used to transmit
//     audio packets.
//
//   - If FEC is enabled, both InterfaceAudioSource and
//     InterfaceAudioRepair interfaces should be configured. The second interface
//     will be used to transmit redundant repair data.
//
// The protocols for the two interfaces should correspond to each other and to the FEC
// scheme. For example, if FecEncodingRs8m is used, the protocols should be
// ProtoRtpRs8mSource and ProtoRs8mRepair.
//
// # Sessions
//
// Receiver creates a session object for every sender connected to it. Sessions can appear
// and disappear at any time. Multiple sessions can be active at the same time.
//
// A session is identified by the sender address. A session may contain multiple packet
// streams sent to different receiver ports. If the sender employs FEC, the session will
// contain source and repair packet streams. Otherwise, the session will contain a single
// source packet stream.
//
// A session is created automatically on the reception of the first packet from a new
// address and destroyed when there are no packets during a timeout. A session is also
// destroyed on other events like a large latency underrun or overrun or broken playback,
// but if the sender continues to send packets, it will be created again shortly.
//
// # Mixing
//
// Receiver mixes audio streams from all currently active sessions into a single output
// stream.
//
// The output stream continues no matter how much active sessions there are at the moment.
// In particular, if there are no sessions, the receiver produces a stream with all zeros.
//
// Sessions can be added and removed from the output stream at any time, probably in the
// middle of a frame.
//
// # Sample rate
//
// Every session may have a different sample rate. And even if nominally all of them are
// of the same rate, device frequencies usually differ by a few tens of Hertz.
//
// Receiver compensates these differences by adjusting the rate of every session stream to
// the rate of the receiver output stream using a per-session resampler. The frequencies
// factor between the sender and the receiver clocks is calculated dynamically for every
// session based on the session incoming packet queue size.
//
// Resampling is a quite time-consuming operation. The user can choose between completely
// disabling resampling (at the cost of occasional underruns or overruns) or several
// resampler profiles providing different compromises between CPU consumption and quality.
//
// # Clock source
//
// Receiver should decode samples at a constant rate that is configured when the receiver
// is created. There are two ways to accomplish this:
//
//   - If the user enabled internal clock (ClockInternal), the receiver employs a
//     CPU timer to block reads until it's time to decode the next bunch of samples
//     according to the configured sample rate.
//
//     This mode is useful when the user passes samples to a non-realtime destination,
//     e.g. to an audio file.
//
//   - If the user enabled external clock (ClockExternal), the samples read from
//     the receiver are decoded immediately and hence the user is responsible to call
//     read operation according to the sample rate.
//
//     This mode is useful when the user passes samples to a realtime destination with its
//     own clock, e.g. to an audio device. Internal clock should not be used in this case
//     because the audio device and the CPU might have slightly different clocks, and the
//     difference will eventually lead to an underrun or an overrun.
//
// # Thread safety
//
// Can be used concurrently.
